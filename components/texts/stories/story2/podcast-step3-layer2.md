title: Context and Themes
---
As growing debates emerge among women from the Global South, discussion about marriage customs in different social and cultural contexts has gained more visibility and context-focused attention. Kazakh female groups, as part of the global South, also joined the critical engagement of current debates on marriage customs and traditions. Along with recognition of the value preserved in traditional culture, many women themselves have begun to critically rethink every aspect of these customs. Through this engagement, rituals once taken for granted are now being reinterpreted, questioned, and discussed in new ways that connect personal experience with broader conversations about gender, culture, and social change.
