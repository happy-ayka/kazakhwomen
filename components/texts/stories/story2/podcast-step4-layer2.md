title: Context and Themes
---
This conversation with ethnic Mongol females reveals that dialogues have expanded beyond the boundaries of the Kazakh cultural sphere, engaging with the experiences of ethnic Mongol and other ethnic groups to form a wider regional conversation across languages, ethnicities, and lived experiences. This dialogue transitioned from critiquing inequalities in traditional marriage customs to the issue of property distribution in families with a nomadic legacy. The conversation highlighted the existing gender inequality from a distribution perspective, thus emphasizing the intersectionality among ethnic minority women's situation, such as the fact that women's plight lies at the intersection of culture, ethnicity, and economy.
