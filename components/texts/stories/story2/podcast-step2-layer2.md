title: Context and Themes
---
Marriage customs and traditions continue to be debated among Kazakh women. As growing debates emerge from women in the Global South, discussion about marriage customs in different social and cultural contexts has gained more visibility and specificity. Kazakh female groups, as part of the global South context, also joined the critical engagement of current debates. Along with recognition of the value preserved in traditional culture, many women themselves have begun to critically rethink every aspect of these customs. Through this engagement, rituals once taken for granted are now being reinterpreted, questioned, and discussed in new ways that connect personal experience with broader conversations about gender, culture, and social change.
