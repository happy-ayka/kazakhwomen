title: The Last Migration and a Sedentary Future 
---

The film follows the intertwined stories of two Kazakh herders' families from the 1980s to the 2010s. It begins with a winter migration followed by a snowstorm and a tragic accident, which increases tensions between the two families. Over generations, these families experienced loss and adaptation as they continued their annual nomadic migrations. The film’s four parts, including winter, spring, summer, and the new century, represent the changes in herders’ lives throughout the social transformation. The pastoral life gradually gives way to modernization: radios are replaced by cell phones, horses are replaced by motorcycles, and education, trade, and ecological policy reshape the steppe. The families complete one last migration, which is not toward new pastures but into government-built settlements, marking the end of transhumance and the beginning of a sedentary future.
