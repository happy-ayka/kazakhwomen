title: Contemporary Women under the Urban Economy
---

The diary records the Ainur's honesty and emotion, showing readers not a “supermom,” but an ordinary woman who, again and again, stands up and fights to reclaim agency over her life. This work is also a social documentary that mirrors the dilemmas of many contemporary women. As a Kazakh, divorced, single mother, and migrant worker, Ainur embodies multiple, intersecting forms of marginality. Her story confronts the pressures of traditional marriage expectations, the precarity of single-parent households, and the burnout of working mothers in China’s urban economy.
