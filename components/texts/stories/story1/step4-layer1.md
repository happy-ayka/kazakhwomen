title: Contemporary Women under the Urban Economy
---

Ainur's records in her diary show her as not a “supermom,” but an ordinary woman who stands up and fights to reclaim agency over her life. This work is also a social documentary that echoes the dilemmas of many contemporary women struggling with multiple identities and responsibilities. As an ethnic Kazakh, divorced, single mother, and migrant worker, Ainur embodies multiple, intersecting forms of marginality. Her story confronts the pressures of traditional marriage expectations, the precarity of single-parent households, and the burnout of working mothers in China’s urban economy.
