She was born in 1934 (Changji) during the late Republican period, with shifting sovereignties and cultural reform movements. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Zholymbet became part of a new generation of ethnic minority women who entered schools, newspapers, and cultural institutions. Since 1952, she has worked in newspapers and radio stations. Writing in both Kazakh and Chinese, she represented the emerging “socialist modern woman” while remaining rooted in Kazakh oral and pastoral traditions. The collection includes nearly 70 poems written by Tursun from the 1970s to the early 21st century. As Tursun was a journalist throughout her life, her thinking spans from the social changes in the Kazakh pastoral areas to the modernization process after the reform and opening up.
