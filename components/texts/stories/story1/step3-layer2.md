The 1980s marked a period of intellectual thaw in China, following the Cultural Revolution, when universities reopened, literary journals proliferated, and writers experimented with new forms of expression. Yerkesh Khurmanbek’s literary formation coincided with this dynamic period in modern Chinese cultural history. This decade also saw the rise of the “Ethnic Minority Literature” (少数民族文学) movement, through which non-Han writers began articulating ethnic subjectivities, ecological ethics, and local cosmologies within the national literary framework.

For Kazakh writers in Xinjiang, this was a moment of cultural reawakening. Socialist modernization had transformed the steppe and redefined gender and labor. Yet the 1980s revival encouraged writers to revisit indigenous myths, oral traditions, and spiritual cosmologies as sources of cultural renewal. Yerkesh’s writing reflects the intellectual and cultural self-reflection of the 1980s generation.
