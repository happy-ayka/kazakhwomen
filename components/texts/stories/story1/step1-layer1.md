title: Migration and Pasture Environment
---

Through the poem, Tursun situates her thoughts in a larger context of relation with a nomadic life, pastoral nature, collective ethnic memory, and womanhood. 

黑山上走来迁徙的队伍 (The Caravan Crossing the Black Mountain), this poem chapter recalls the historical migrations of Kazakhs. She connects the challenging experience of migration and renewal, and constructs a bridge between generations, between her ancestors’ migration roots across mountains and her own witness of urban modernity in the capital, Beijing. Her poem says that she witnesses migration from hardship to dignity, from horse to automobile, from survival to knowledge.  

Chapters named我出生的大山 (The Mountain Where I Was Born), 恼火 (Anger), and 山（一）（二） (The Mountain I, II), show the author’s changing relationship with nature and hometown. She expressed nostalgia for her past life and, through her revisits to the mountains and steppes, she witnesses the transformed homeland, modern industry, and electric light where she once herded sheep. She recognizes progress and, at the same time, laments the loss.

Especially, she challenges the romanticization of mountains, as “Anger” (1975) expresses her ecological anxiety. She laments environmental destruction, deforestation, mining, and drying rivers, and condemns herself for not protecting the steppe.
