The film’s forty-year turn parallels China’s broader transformation since the Reform and Opening period (1978–present). Beginning in the 1980s, the state implemented the “sedentarization and ecological restoration” (定居兴牧) and “return grazing land to grassland” (退牧还草) policies, aiming to modernize pastoral regions and protect the fragile environment. For Kazakh and Mongol herders in Xinjiang, this meant a gradual end to seasonal migrations that had sustained their culture for centuries. While these policies promised education, healthcare, and stability, they also disrupted traditional lifeways and kinship networks. With the inevitability of modernization, nomads needed to sedentarize and leave the steppe.
