Born in the 1990s to a Kazakh family in Xinjiang, Ainur matured during a time when educational expansion, online culture, and gender discourse opened new spaces for self-expression, yet traditional norms remained powerful within families and ethnic communities. Her Diary of a Single Mother represents the conflict between individual autonomy and patriarchal expectations, and highlights the emotional costs of being simultaneously urban, female, minority, and single. In the 21st century, for Kazakh women writers, it also signals a generational transition, from the mythic and collective voices of the 1970s-1980s–1990s to the confessional realism of the digital era. Through her diary form and self-reflection, Ainur situates Kazakh womanhood within the moral and economic transformations of modern China.
