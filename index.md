## Welcome to the digital exhibition genealogy of women’s literature and thoughts from the 1970s to the present.
This digital exhibition traces how generations of Kazakh women have written and imagined their lives across socialism, modernization, and globalization processes. It brings together women’s writings, conversations, and drawings. By connecting literature and digital media, I hope to build a living archive that makes their voices heard across time and place.
